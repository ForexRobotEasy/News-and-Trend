## Functionality
The News and Trend Forex Software operates as follows:

1. Global Variables: The code defines two global variables - `breakeven` and `newsImpact`. The `breakeven` variable represents the customizable breakeven level, while the `newsImpact` variable indicates the news impact indicator. 

2. Expert Advisor Start Function (`OnInit`): This function is executed when the expert advisor is initialized. Initialization code can be added here.

3. Expert Advisor Tick Function (`OnTick`): This function is executed on each tick of the market. It first checks for news impact using the `CheckNewsImpact` function. If news impact is detected, it executes trading based on the news impact. If no news impact is detected, it checks for trend impact using the `CheckTrendImpact` function. If trend impact is detected, it executes trading based on the trend impact.

4. Check News Impact Function (`CheckNewsImpact`): This function implements the logic to check the news impact. It returns true if news impact is detected and false otherwise.

5. Check Trend Impact Function (`CheckTrendImpact`): This function implements the logic to check the trend impact. It returns true if trend impact is detected and false otherwise.

6. Execute Trade Function (`ExecuteTrade`): This function executes the trading based on the detected news or trend impact. It uses technical indicators and the breakeven level for trading decisions. The example code opens a Buy trade with a specified lot size, stop loss, and take profit levels.

7. Expert Advisor Deinitialization Function (`OnDeinit`): This function is executed when the expert advisor is deinitialized. Deinitialization code can be added here.

8. Error Handling Functions (`OnTradeError` and `OnChartEvent`): These functions handle trade errors and chart events respectively. Code for error handling can be added here.
